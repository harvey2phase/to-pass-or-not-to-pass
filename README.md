# To PASS or not to PASS
Visualization tool to help *you* decide if you should PASS a grade at Dalhousie University

## How to use this tool

Enter your current cGPA, the number of hours counting towards that cGPA (should be a multiple of 3 and a maximum of 120 for a 4-year bachelor's degree), and the numerical grade (between 0 and 4.3) that you're thinking of passing. The resulting plot shows how your cGPA would then change if you took another course in the future without the PASSing option.

Caution: There is no error checking for input correctness.

### Interpretation

The x-axis shows all possible grades in a course in a future semester, and the y-axis shows your new cGPA for all possible x's, depending on whether you PASSed the course or not. In other words, the slopes show how sensitive your cGPA is to new grades (perturbations) if you PASSed the class in question.

## Disclaimer

I have not thoroughly tested the program. Please verify your results at [Dal's official GPA caculation site](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/grades-and-student-records/gpa-calculator.html).

You can also play with the [Desmos plot](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tz9tp81hqi) that I used to calculate the projected GPAs.

Message me on Discord or email me at harvey@dal.ca if you found any errors or have any questions.

Thank you!! Enjoy!
