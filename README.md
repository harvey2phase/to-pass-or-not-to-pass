# to-pass-or-not-to-pass
Visualization tool to help you decide if you should PASS a grade at Dalhousie University

## How to use this tool

### Demo

Enter your current cGPA, the number of hours counting towards your cGPA (should be a multiple of 3 and a maximum of 120 for a 4-year bachelor's degree), and the numerical grade (between 0 and 4.3) that you're thinking of passing. The resulting plots show how your cGPA would then change if you took another course in the future without the PASSing option.

### Interpretation

The x-axis shows all possible grades in a course in a new semester, and the y-axis shows your new cGPA for all possible x's, depedning on whether you PASSed the course or not. In other words, the slope shows how sensitive your cGPA is to new grades (perturbations) if you PASSed the class in question.

## Disclaimer

I have not thoroughly tested the program. Please verify your results at [Dal's official GPA caculation site](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/grades-and-student-records/gpa-calculator.html).

You can also play with the [Desmos plot](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tz9tp81hqi) that I used to calculate the projected GPAs.
