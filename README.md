## Disclaimer

I have not thoroughly tested the program. Please verify your results at [Dal's official GPA caculation site](https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/grades-and-student-records/gpa-calculator.html).

You can also play with the [Desmos plot](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tz9tp81hqi) that I used to calculate the projected GPAs.

Message me on Discord or email me at harvey@dal.ca if you found any errors or have any questions.

Thank you!! Enjoy!
